## Abstract
Our main question is “How has legalizing and prohibiting abortions in the United States, had an effect on the opinion of abortion?” This topic is important because the logical basis on which federal rights to access an abortion was granted, directly contradicts the indirect cultural and religious-based forces on which the federal right was removed for the right to safe and equal access to abortion. To address this question we will research the influences that affect the opinion on abortion such as financial resource availability, and roadblocks to accessing information and procedure. We are concerned with how attitudes have shifted over a period of time in which abortion was un-legalized and then legal. To address this concern we plan to look through data and surveys of how these issues reflect in not only laws but also the number of abortions being performed versus the amount legally available.


## Keywords
Abortion, public opinion, healthcare accessibility


## Introduction
Our research project aims to explore the topic of abortion in the United States: how its relationship with the law has affected public opinion about abortions, how opinions about abortion have changed over the last few years due to the change in presidency and other lawmakers, and what possible roadblocks may exist that prevent or hinder one from receiving abortions or abortion-related healthcare. We hope to gain insight into these topics through analyzing and organizing existing data to find trends, causes, and existing solutions.


## Problem Domain
Power is made through force, control is obtained by force, and the more control one has over something, the more powerful their position in a situation becomes. Power and control are mainly about choice, and there are many forces of situational factors that go into the decision of getting or not getting an abortion. Tension among these values is present when reducing the amount of Planned Parenthoods in a state, which may support less legal obtainable access to abortions, but also decreases the amount of accurate obtainable, family planning and pregnancy prevention services available to the community. Those who are religious value the possible promotion of abstinence in a country that has no standardized sex education course for its developing minds of students. Economically, less planned parenthood means less money being spent on these avenues for access. But also means less access to healthcare and available sexual health knowledge, and economically, many abandoned buildings in communities.

The stakeholders of the issue are healthcare providers, pharmacists, and lawyers. These are the people who know the barriers to access outside of the law and address them, such as gender-neutral spaces, high affordability services, and physical or legal protection when requesting an abortion. The indirect stakeholders are psychologists who have carriers as their clients, the sexual health education system, and the welfare system. Psychologists are concerned about the mental health of carriers being forced to carry to term without proper financial/emotional support, housing, or a properly planned future with a child (or dealing with the effect of postpartum). Social welfare workers will have a huge influx of cases needing government assistance, as well as general parenting knowledge. The education system will have to confront the outside forces on education preventing students across the country from receiving adequate and standardized sexual health curriculum throughout their educational career.

If intervention is done with data and technology, the benefits are there’s more access to sexual health education, possible earlier knowledge of pregnancy among carriers, and the creation of a community surrounding unexpected pregnancies & abortion access. The potential harms are loss of privacy concerning sexual activity/health, with data now being collected. Stakeholders likely to benefit from a data or technology-based intervention are pharmacists, lawyers, and the sexual health education system. Stakeholders likely to be harmed by this intervention are healthcare providers, the welfare system, and psychologists. Unintended consequences of data intervention could be the spread of misinformation, the exposure of individual private information regarding sexual activity, and the public indiscretion concerning an individual's choice in preventative pregnancy methods.

## Research Questions
Abortion in the United States of America has been an alternative, last-step method for pregnancy intervention and prevention for the last 50 years. However, in recent times the case ruling that made this possible, ‘Roe v. Wade,’ was overturned in June 2022, effectively removing the federal right to have access to an abortion procedure. Both before and after the legalization of abortion, due to many reasons such as conflicting socioenvironmental beliefs, lack of access to medical/surgical services, lack of financial resources, or fear of judgment - people have sought out dangerous, non-scientifically backed, alternative abortion solutions. Thus, we seek to research the following questions:
1. How has legalizing and prohibiting abortions in the United States affected public opinion on abortions?
2. How has funding for abortions impacted abortion-related services in California?
3. What are some financial roadblocks that impact the accessibility of abortion in California, and what are people doing to get around them?

Detailed information regarding timing cut-offs on procedures (i.e., the maximum number of weeks into a pregnancy that the clinic will provide abortion services) were found on a clinic’s website or by calling the clinic directly.

## Expected Implications
One possible implication for technologists, designers, and policymakers, is that the information in the data cannot be disregarded. For example, when taking a look at opinions on the issue of the legalization of abortion, it is already shown that over half of adults support it [(source)](www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/). This should be enough to require the attention and action of policymakers since it is already a current issue that is progressing and affecting many. This should also push technologists to continue to create visualizations and graphs that demonstrate this relevant information since it will continue to stay relevant as a controversial issue. Other possible implications that could result are those regarding policymakers once again, with the issue of the costs of abortions. While abortions have not been federally funded, that trend might change as states are now pushing to provide coverage through some healthcare plans. This could trigger a change on the federal level, with the hope that it could ease the burden of costs from abortion services.


## Limitations 
Some limitations that could be addressed are those regarding the opinions and experiences of people from underrepresented demographics, in addition to those who might not have access to the internet, or who are unable to be interviewed regarding the topic of abortion. Although the sources present excellent data and insight, it should be noted that there could have been some limitations on where and how much input was received from people. For example, polls that are offered online could skew results because the internet is often the first thing that is needed for people to take the polls, which some people may not have access to. These kinds of variables must be kept in mind when analyzing research and data regarding how data is collected, especially from online sources. Also, the limitation on the representation of political parties is also another thing to note as often only the two main dominating parties (Republicans and Democrats) are most often represented. Other people could have different views, and might not identify with a political party, so that should be kept in mind as well.


## Findings 
Our project focused on analyzing abortion trends in California specifically. We aimed to analyze the trends of how abortions relationship with the law has shifted. Accomplishing this through exploring how public opinion toward abortion shifts over a time period where it was un-legalized and then legal.

We found that under any circumstances, that of Calfornia residents, 62% of survey participants believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances. Of the five questions asked of respondents for opinion on abortion legalization under specific circumstances, in each state 50% of respondents believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances. This doesnt deviate from the trend until asked “Do you think abortion should be legal or illegal if the women does not wish to be pregnant.” In 17 out of 50 states, 50% of respondents believe abortion should be legal under this circumstance. Showing that the biggest discrpancy during abortion being un-legalized then legal, was in fact that the opinion on abortion permamnence is that the most political dipute is when its completely the womans choices, not based on medical necessity but based on situatuional circumstance.

Funding for abortion related medical services has remained the same in California, with a large amount of funds dedicated to the services. In addition to this, the number of people to receive abortion related service funding has decreased over time in California. The amount of people over all receiving funding for abortion related services has continously decreased since 2014, with the biggest funding difference in ages 15-24 years, while for those aged 25-45+ years, the decrease in requested funding wasnt as dramatic.

There are many financial roadblocks to receiving an abortion, such as driving time which concerns gas prices and transportation, or paying fee for appointment versus bundled care, as well as paying for recovery through missed time at work and additional necessary over the counter medication. We chose to focus on driving times, distance specifically. Many locations with abortion services, can not perform all types of abortions nor have the skill and capacity to perform at the time of current gestation period. Due to this, people have to drive farther for abortion services. Through our data we found that as the pregnancy is farther along, it takes longer to reach the nearest abortion clinic. Often the second nearest is in the different province of the area, making the commute farther and abortion services more inaccessible.


## Discussion
Among these research questions was an interesting contradiction within lack of proper medical testing for pregnancy and the limit on abortion placed in effect by individual state laws. Many states limit when someone can receive an abortion based on the weeks of gestation. However, many of these laws place these limits at a time before many people have knowledge of pregnancy. People often find out they are pregnant after the state limit has surpassed. This is due to testing before the HCG levels are too early to detect, as well as many women don't produce enough HCG to be detectable until much later into the pregnancy term.

The biggest discrepancy in opinion on abortion legalization occcred when the circumstances were fully determined by a womens autonomy. This highlights the intersectionality of the problem domain of the issue. Economically, most respondents agree abortions are beneficial for medical circumstances as well as various cases of physical assault. Scientifically, abortions are performed when safe and also at times when medically necessary. But when considering that a woman may not want to bring a person into a life that they can not financially, emotionally, and physically provide for them, is where the societal standard shown through survey responses refutes the reasoning as injustice and unnecessary medical action, or murder under some current state laws.

The physical distance to abortion clinics is a huge limiting factor. Abortion clinics often perform other medical services such as provide contraceptives, sexual health screenings and testing, pregnancy tests and ultrasounds, as well as can serve as a first point of refuge for domestic assault victims. The physical location of clinics can prevent women from getting an abortion, but also can prevent them from having a healthy pregnancy, as well as gaining the pre-cursor knowledge for avoiding pregnancy. This leads to misinformation, accidental pregnancies having to be carried to term without a stable life foundation to enter. Moreover, a decrease in visitor frequency can impact the funding and permanence of the abortion clinic location, further negatively impacting the accessibility of abortion.


## Conclusion
This project was focused on analyzing abortion trends more specifically in the United States. As abortion access is a very relevant and ongoing issue, it is important to see the closer details and specific obstacles or reasons why abortion is being seen as the way it is. We believe that through this project people are able to better understand abortion and the various obstacles that are present when women need to receive one. Although these datasets are based on the state of California, it is also important to consider as there is a large population there and so it is easier to obtain more data that can prove useful in research papers or projects like these. Oftentimes, some members of the public are unable to understand that there are various factors to consider when an abortion is necessary such as the avaliability of abortion clinics, the legal process and opinions of others, as well as the distance between abortion clinic and distance from home. It is also important to consider where women can get funding for abortions and the responsibility that the certain companies as well as the state government should have when planning for healthcare services such as ones that cover abortion. Through our investigation and report into this issue, some key findings were that public opinions on abortion in the state of California was more liberal and more likely to want to legalize abortion, specifically, a majority of 62% of Californians are in support of legalizing abortion under any circumstances. In addition, there was a large amount of funding dedicated to abortion especially in counties such as Los Angeles county, were it was more likely to be funded by medi-cal. Which is something that other states should consider when planning budgets for healthcare services. Lastly, driving times to an abortion clinic is an average of about 1 minute, which demonstrates the accessibility of abortion services likely due to many abortion clinics that are near many cities and also that are clustered in the state of California. This project highlighted important data sets such as the ones listed above, in order to educate the general public as well as to focus on a great model that the state of California has made for itself. It is with hope that as we progress as a society, these data statistics are considered and looked up to in order to make abortion access easier, safer, and more efficient for everyone.
