## Abstract
Our main question is “How has legalizing and prohibiting abortions in the United States, had an effect on the opinion of abortion?” This topic is important because the logical basis on which federal rights to access an abortion was granted, directly contradicts the indirect cultural and religious-based forces on which the federal right was removed for the right to safe and equal access to abortion. To address this question we will research the influences that affect the opinion on abortion such as financial resource availability, and roadblocks to accessing information and procedure. We are concerned with how attitudes have shifted over a period of time in which abortion was un-legalized and then legal. To address this concern we plan to look through data and surveys of how these issues reflect in not only laws but also the number of abortions being performed versus the amount legally available.

## Keywords
Abortion, public opinion, healthcare accessibility

## Introduction
Our research project aims to explore the topic of abortion in the United States: how its relationship with the law has affected public opinion about abortions, how opinions about abortion have changed over the last few years due to the change in presidency and other lawmakers, and what possible roadblocks may exist that prevent or hinder one from receiving abortions or abortion-related healthcare. We hope to gain insight into these topics through analyzing and organizing existing data to find trends, causes, and existing solutions.

## Problem Domain
Many of the scientific, social, governmental, and economic issues and arguments surrounding abortion tend to intersect, often directly contradicting each other, yet the presence is just as prominent. The issue in the scientific community among abortions is determining at what month of pregnancy, if not for the carrier's immediate health concern, does one not allow an abortion procedure? This brings the debate about prevention versus what many religious groups would call murder. Many religious groups believe spiritual life begins at conception, and that is equivalent to a person with rights. From this perspective, abortion is seen as murder, a punishable offense. This debate raises the argument about when life begins, and when life comes into a person with rights - it presents a very unique side of legal procedures. In pregnancy, the carrier is the only form of life support, with their own financial and personal forces combining to make or not make the decision to grow and support life. As a person with rights, ongoing life, consciousness, autonomy, and social and financial forces, should one have the right to choose whether to use their body for the incubation of a fetus.

The human values most present in this problem are power and control. Power is made through force, control is obtained by force, and the more control one has over something, the more powerful their position in a situation becomes. This is because power and control are all about choice, and there are many forces due to situational factors that go into the decision of getting or not getting an abortion. Tension among these values is present within the arguments, such as reducing the amount of Planned Parenthoods in a state, which may support less legal obtainable access to abortions, but also decreases the amount of accurate obtainable, pregnancy-preventing sexual knowledge available to the community. Those who are religious value the possible reduced sexual promiscuity, and promotion of abstinence from the overturned ruling - in a country that has no standardized sex education course for its developing minds of students. Economically, less planned parenthood means less money being assigned and spent on these avenues for healthcare access. But this also means less access to healthcare, a decrease in available sexual health knowledge, and economically, many abandoned buildings in communities. Carriers of pregnancy want the power to choose whether to carry a fetus to term. The scientific community aims to control the cutoff for when someone can receive an abortion and the different methods accessible based on location, health condition, and timeline of pregnancy. Cultural religious groups want the power to deny the right to choose to have a child, with no one receiving a choice – no matter the health of the carrier, financial forces affecting the decision, mental health state, or current environmental factors potentially dangerous to the fetus and carrier.

The stakeholders of the issue are healthcare providers, pharmacists, and lawyers. These are the people who know the barriers to access outside of the law and address them, such as gender-neutral spaces, high affordability services, and physical or legal protection when requesting an abortion. The indirect stakeholders are psychologists who have carriers as their clients, school systems that have to adapt to higher pregnancy rates, the sexual health education system, and social welfare workers. Psychologists are concerned about the mental health of carriers being forced to carry to term without proper financial/emotional support, housing, previous knowledge of a developing pregnancy, or a properly planned future with a child (or dealing with the effect of postpartum, whether the child is kept or given away). Social welfare workers will have a huge influx of cases needing government assistance, as well as general parenting knowledge. The education system will have to confront the outside legal and religious forces on the education course and textbook system preventing students across the country from receiving adequate and standardized sexual health curriculum throughout their educational career and maturity.

If intervention is done with data and technology, there are many things to consider. The benefits could be that there is more access to sexual health education, possible earlier knowledge of pregnancy among carriers, and the creation of a supportive community surrounding unexpected pregnancies or abortion access. The potential harms are loss of privacy concerning sexual activity and health, and the possible social criminalization of those who choose to be educated about abortion and the systems that make it accessible. Stakeholders likely to benefit from a data or technology-based intervention are pharmacists, lawyers, school systems, and the sexual health education system. Stakeholders likely to be harmed by this intervention are healthcare providers, social welfare workers, and psychologists. Unintended consequences of data intervention could be the spread of misinformation, the exposure of individual private information regarding sexual activity, and the public indiscretion concerning an individual's choice in preventative pregnancy methods.

## Research Questions
Abortion in the United States of America has been an alternative, last-step method for pregnancy intervention and prevention for the last 50 years. However, in recent times the case ruling that made this possible, ‘Roe v. Wade,’ was overturned in June 2022, effectively removing the federal right to have access to an abortion procedure. Both before and after the legalization of abortion, due to many reasons such as conflicting socioenvironmental beliefs, lack of access to medical/surgical services, lack of financial resources, or fear of judgment - people have sought out dangerous, non-scientifically backed, alternative abortion solutions. Thus, we seek to research the following questions:
1. How has legalizing and prohibiting abortions in the United States affected public opinion on abortions?
2. How have opinions on abortions changed over the last three years in the United States?
3. How has the funding for abortions changed over the last three years in the United States?
4. What are some financial roadblocks that impact the accessibility of abortion, and what are people doing to get around them?

## Expected Implications
One possible implication for technologists, designers, and policymakers, is that the information in the data cannot be disregarded. For example, when taking a look at opinions on the issue of the legalization of abortion, it is already shown that over half of adults support it [(source)](www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/). This should be enough to require the attention and action of policymakers since it is already a current issue that is progressing and affecting many. This should also push technologists to continue to create visualizations and graphs that demonstrate this relevant information since it will continue to stay relevant as a controversial issue. Other possible implications that could result are those regarding policymakers once again, with the issue of the costs of abortions. While abortions have not been federally funded, that trend might change as states are now pushing to provide coverage through some healthcare plans. This could trigger a change on the federal level, with the hope that it could ease the burden of costs from abortion services.

## Limitations
Some limitations that could be addressed are those regarding the opinions and experiences of people from underrepresented demographics, in addition to those who might not have access to the internet, or who are unable to be interviewed regarding the topic of abortion. Although the sources present excellent data and insight, it should be noted that there could have been some limitations on where and how much input was received from people. For example, polls that are offered online could skew results because the internet is often the first thing that is needed for people to take the polls, which some people may not have access to. These kinds of variables must be kept in mind when analyzing research and data regarding how data is collected, especially from online sources. Also, the limitation on the representation of political parties is also another thing to note as often only the two main dominating parties (Republicans and Democrats) are most often represented. Other people could have different views, and might not identify with a political party, so that should be kept in mind as well.
