    California was more liberal and more likely to want to legalize abortion. In 
    addition, there was a large amount of funding dedicated to abortion,
    especially in counties such as Los Angeles County, where it was more likely 
    to be funded by Medi-Cal. Lastly, there were less driving times present as
